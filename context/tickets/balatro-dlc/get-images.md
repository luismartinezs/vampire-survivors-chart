I need to scrape images from https://vampire.survivors.wiki/w/Weapon and use them in this codebase to display in the frontend

this is a rough list of steps I need to follow

- batch download images from https://vampire.survivors.wiki/w/Weapon, with a meaningful name
- convert images to webp if they aren't
- embed the images to css, with a meaningful name similar to styles/ode/weapons.css

Once the files are downloaded, I will manually need to separate them into categories to group them

docs/gen-image.md lists a process I have used previously, although it is not precisely what I need, it is close
